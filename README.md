# Optimized Budget Allocation with Linear Programming ðŸš€

This project implements a **linear programming model** using `lpSolve` in **R** to optimize budget allocation across different constraints (5K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 25K, 30K, 35K). The goal is to maximize efficiency while adhering to predefined constraints.

## Features
- **Linear Programming Model**: Uses `lpSolve` for optimization.
- **Multiple Budget Constraints**: Supports allocations for 5K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 25K, 30K and 35K.
- **Efficient Resource Distribution**: Ensures optimal allocation across given constraints.
- **Implemented in R**: Uses an open-source approach with `lpSolve`.
